            <p>Hi^_^, all. This is my assignment <b>4</b>…  more and more clear!（๑ • ‿ • ๑ ）<br/>
                <br/>As I started to create changes to my card sorting content, I was thinking about what secondary navigation to place in the existing primary navigation and what content could be placed below this tab page. By following this logic, I overlooked two issues. Firstly, there may have been a problem with my first level navigation content at the outset, and this was fully reflected in the card sorting. Without intervening, I saw certain differences between the user's card sorting content and mine, and this inspired me to always think from the user's point of view. Secondly, because I populated the navigation tabs in a sequential order, I added 'Membership' to 'About' when I got to the last tab, 'About', in order to balance the content of each navigation bar. ' tab, without thinking that this was not really logical for the user.<br/>
                <br/>I still found a number of issues which have given me direction for improving the site. In the later assignments, I think research will still be the main way of revising and touching up my website, because whenever we do, we need to think from the user's point of view, in other words: <b><u>"Put yourself in others' Mouses"</u></b> hahaha!<br/>
                <br/>With this in mind, I would make lots of upgrade next time...
